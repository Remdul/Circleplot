==========

A repot for teaching and putting circles on a map

Intructions:
1. Clone the repo, and add your name or handle to the contributors.txt file. Push your changes back to the master branch


Tasks:
1: There is a set of sample data in this repository. This data consists of a point name, MGRS coordinates, a radius and a description of the point. Your task is to write a program to parse the file and then return the data back to you. Note that all of the radiuses should be expressed as meters when they are displayed  back, but the sample data contains mixed units. For this portion of the task, each student should create their own branch of this repo. Make sure to push your branch back into the origin.
