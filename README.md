A repot for teaching and putting circles on a map

#Intructions:
1. Clone the repo, and add your name or handle to the contributors.txt file. Push your changes back to the master branch


#Tasks:
1. There is a set of sample data in this repository. This data consists of a point name, MGRS coordinates, a radius and a description of the point. Your task is to write a program to parse the file and then return the data back to you. Note that all of the radiuses should be expressed as meters when they are displayed  back, but the sample data contains mixed units. For this portion of the task, each student should create their own branch of this repo. Make sure to push your branch back into the origin.

#How to get things to compile:
1. Get a compiler if you are on a debian system, run
`sudo apt-get install gcc`
2. Write some code. This repo has an example hello_world.cpp program
3. Compile your code. Note that if you forget to specify an output file, it will go to a.out
`g++ -o hello hello_world.cpp`
4. Run your program
`./hello`
